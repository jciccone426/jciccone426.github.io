    <h1>Here's what you add in your Cydia sources: https://jciccone426.github.io/repo/</h1>
    <h1>This is my amazing page(s), as the title suggests, this is a website for my tweaks,projects,photoshops and so on! Enjoy!</h1>
    <img src="fpotd/fpotd_mbpnews.png" alt="Featured Post of the Day: MBP News!" width=40% style="float: right"/>

    <h1>So this main page will feature a news post of the day with a nice little picture next to it :). Currently there isn't any big news or projects I have going on. However I have just updated my setup.
      Now you're probably thinking, what does this mean? Well my workflow will be quite a bit more efficent. I was using a MacBook Air previously, which while it is a great computer, Apple hasn't really kept up with it.
       Almost all of Apple's line up features a retina display, a drastically higher resolution compared to the Air's 1440x900 TN Panel. </h1>
       <h1>Which was my biggest problem. While creating this website, I found my self trying
       to cram my entire workflow which caused me confusion and more problems. I decided to purchase a MacBook Pro 15" 2015 with a Retina Display. The specifications are a nice 45w i7 Quad-Core, Iris Pro graphics, 500gb Flash storage and 16gb DDR3 ram.
        I chose a 2015 model because of it's legacy ports, it would be costly to get adapters for everything I own and just pointless since I own no USB-C devices. Anyway that wraps up my first "news" article on the website, now go explore!
