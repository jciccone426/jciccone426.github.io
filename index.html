     	<p>Somehow you have arrived to my website, rather it be through Google, GitHub or I just plain gave it to you, welcome!</p>
     	
        
        <p>This site was created as an archive, just to show off my work and to host files which I will get to later, first I'll explain archive. My archive at the moment is my MacBook Pro, which is private and no one can see my work unless I pull out my Mac. This website is my solution. Hopefully soon I can upload all my work here. </p>
        <p>As for hosting files, I do a lot of development and it makes life way easier when you can just head to a common URL and grab what you need. I hope to integrate my HTML5 games into their own pages but I'm not sure if GitHub allows that to be done since these pages are static after all. Anyway, enjoy your stay.  </p>
        <p> The iOS Downloads page will be geared towards providing software for jailbreaking/working with your iDevice in an un-normal way(such as betas). I can't tell you how many times I tried to find that one version of RedSn0w that doesn't seem to exist anywhere. Speaking of iOS, tweaks will be hosted here. This GitHub repo is also a Cydia source! Tweaks will be listed in the tweaks page along with the repo's URL.</p>
        <p> Surprised I didn't mention Photoshop yet! No big deal, the Photoshop page will be home to all my PSD files along with exported files. Beware, I don't work with 70ppi. These images will be huge and high resolution most of the time.</p> <p>Lastly, we do have a News page. I am thinking of integrating a popular blogging platform into it since using paragraph tags to put news on my site would be extremely disorganized. News will consist of anything I feel is news worthy to post.</p>
