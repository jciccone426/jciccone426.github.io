    <h1>Of course there is an about page! Let me introduce myself, I am Jon Ciccone.</h1>
    <p>
      On occasion, I am asked where/when/how I learned my skills with technology so I would like to state that.
      At around 7 or 8 years old when I played with a ThinkPad T2x(21 or 22?), I really loved using it regardless of the fact it was slow(Pentium 3 on XP, 256mbs of ram, me trying to play 3D apps LOL). I really had an obsession at the time
      with anything that involved technology. Such as cell phones,little pda tablets, and so on.
      All of my usage with that ThinkPad resulted in my parents buying me my own laptop, a lovely Compaq Presario CQ60-211DX(Celeron 580 2.16ghz,Intel GMA 4500,2gbs of ram). I would go on to use this laptop for around 7 years.
       Youtube was getting pretty big around this time, and many tutorials were being uploaded for all types of computer software related things.
        From a small registry tweak to coding a Visual Basics program. I was learning it all during this time. I coded a plugin for Minecraft through Java at one point(coding it was horrifying, never again).
        Games really interested me, so it gave me the motivation to create my own. I discovered a program called Game Maker. Now let me say this program has REALLY evolved since that time, making it a fantastic program that I purchased now in 2018.
        Anyway, Game Maker tutorials were everywhere. I learned everything from top down shooters to 3D Doom styled games. Software wasn't the only thing pinging my interest though, hardware interested me as well.
         I began researching building computers and learning what each part does. Soon I upgraded my Compaq Presario CQ60-211DX's Celeron 580 to a Core 2 Duo 2.0ghz. This was a pretty big deal since I hadn't done many
         hardware related things. I eventually got old enough to purchase computers off eBay myself which led to more hardware related stuff. I started working at a computer shop at around 15 which opened me up to many things.
         I was now working hands on with computers during the week days every week. Eventually that came to an end as the shop's owner passed, I was allowed to take home many parts which helped me build up my first real setup which was really awesome.
         It's now 2018, I have custom rig running a Xeon x5650, 22gbs of ram, GTX 960 2GB GDDR5 all on a Asus P6T-SE motherboard(LGA 1366, a pretty rare platform). I hope you enjoyed my little biography, hopefully it answered any questions.
